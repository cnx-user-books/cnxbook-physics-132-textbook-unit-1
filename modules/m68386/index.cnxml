In the figure below we have a wave, and we can talk about the wavelength, <m:math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><m:semantics><m:mi>λ</m:mi><m:annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0">λ</m:annotation></m:semantics></m:math>, which is the distance from one point on the wave through the same point. </para>

    <caption>Wave Diagram (Credit: Krishnavedala)</caption></figure><para id="import-auto-idm905056800">Wavelength could be from peak to peak or from zero to zero or from trough to trough. All those distances are the same, and the wavelength is measured in meters. </para>
    <para id="import-auto-idm954488720">We also have the idea of the amplitude. The difference from either peak to the middle average or from trough to the middle average is what we call the amplitude. </para>
    <para id="import-auto-idm1068535488">In addition to wavelength and amplitude, we can also talk about how long it takes for a point to go up and down. Think about one point on the wave, bouncing up and down. We can talk about how long it takes for that point on the wave to go from trough to peak to trough, the amount of time that takes is called the period, <m:math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><m:semantics><m:mi>T</m:mi><m:annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0">T</m:annotation></m:semantics></m:math>, and will be measured in seconds. </para>
    <para id="import-auto-idm854968496">IN For this class, we will work in SI, International System of Units, we will not work in, what I call barbaric units, there shall be no inches. Meters, kilograms, and seconds will be the norm. On the Moodle page there's a document of math I expect you to know, it's things like trigonometry and area of a circle, but I also expect you to know the SI prefixes Nano - Giga. I will not give you these, and on an exam if you come to the TA's and ask how big a micrometer is, we're going to have to say tough cookie, that's something you were supposed to know. </para>
    <para xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="import-auto-idm358218224">The period is the time it takes for a point on the wave to go up and down, measured in seconds, but I can also count how many that point oscillates in one second. I could say how many oscillations per second this point on this wave make? That quantity is known as the frequency and its value is <equation id="eip-idm1397742768"><m:math display="block"><m:semantics><m:mrow><m:mi>f</m:mi><m:mo stretchy="false">=</m:mo><m:mfrac><m:mn>1</m:mn><m:mi>T</m:mi></m:mfrac></m:mrow><m:annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0">f= {1} over {T}</m:annotation></m:semantics></m:math></equation>, the unit of frequency is how many per second or one over seconds, which is called Hertz. </para><para id="import-auto-idm359268736">We will use these basic terms for all of the waves we discuss, electrons and light. </para>
    <para xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="import-auto-idm933349120">We know that wavelength is measured in meters and we know that frequency is in Hertz, or 1 over seconds, so <m:math display="block"><m:semantics><m:mrow><m:mi>λ</m:mi><m:mi>∙</m:mi><m:mi>f</m:mi></m:mrow><m:annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0">λ ∙ f</m:annotation></m:semantics></m:math> will be meters over seconds which is a velocity. What's the only velocity that we could have? The speed of the wave, it's the only speed we could talk about, so we have the speed of the wave is going to be <equation id="eip-idm791312320"><m:math display="block"><m:semantics><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>v</m:mi><m:mo stretchy="false">=</m:mo><m:mi>λ</m:mi></m:mrow><m:mi>f</m:mi></m:mrow><m:annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0">v=λ f</m:annotation></m:semantics></m:math></equation></para><para id="import-auto-idm346868352">If we know that the speed of a wave is fixed, for example, light travels at a fixed speed, then if the frequency goes up, what's the wavelength going to do? </para>
    <para id="import-auto-idm971198736">We know that <m:math xmlns:m="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><m:semantics><m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mi>v</m:mi><m:mo stretchy="false">=</m:mo><m:mi>λ</m:mi></m:mrow><m:mi>f</m:mi></m:mrow><m:annotation encoding="StarMath 5.0">v=λ f</m:annotation></m:semantics></m:math>. The speed is fixed, if the frequency goes up, and lambda times f has to be the same thing, then that is going to tell me that the wavelength must go down. </para>
